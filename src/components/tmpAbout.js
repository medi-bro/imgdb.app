      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>
        Medical Direct was founded in 2012 in Loma Linda, California by Dr.
        Raymon Stanz and Dr. Egon Spengler. Both are experts in Radiology and
        have treated patients for over 25 years. Seeing that there was something
        to be gained by patients and providers, Dr. Stanz and Dr. Spengler set
        out to create a new service that would make accessing vital patient
        imaging data easier, thus Medical Direct was born.

      <h1>What We Do</h1>
      <p>
        Medical Direct provides quick access to imaging data to patients,
        primary care physicians, and other providers quickly and efficently. At
        a glance, a patient or provider can view imaging data, prognoses, and
        other information in one place. There is no need to wait for hard copies
        of X-rays or other types of medical images, as they can be quickly
        uploaded to one place.

      <h1>About Dr. Stanz</h1>
      <p>
        Dr. Stanz was born in Fontana, California in 1962. At a young age, Dr.
        Stanz loved helping others and volunteered his time working with the
        Loma Linda University Medical Center. He went on to graduate from Loma
        Linda University with a degree in Radiology. It was during his practice
        that he saw the need for patients to have easier access to their medical
        images. Dr. Stanz spoke with Computer Science students from UCR and
        CSUSB to form a foundational knowledge of how this could be achieved.

      <h1>About Dr. Spengler</h1>
      <p>
        Dr. Spengler was born in Albany, New Yourkin in 1960. He was initially
        interested in pursuing a degree in history but after his brother
        suffered a tragic head injury, he became interested in medical care and
        pursued a degree in Radiology from Long Island University. After moving
        to California, Dr. Spengler came to hear about Dr. Stanz work in
        creating a unified system for patient imaging data. Dr. Spengler reached
        out to Dr. Stanz and offered his expertise in the field of medical
        imaging.
